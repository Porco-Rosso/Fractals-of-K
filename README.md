Fractals-of-K
===========

Repository for development of the iphone LockHTML3 theme: "Fractals of K"

This is currently a Work In Progress, do not expect it to work perfectly. It is largely incomplete, but is far enough along to warrant being hosted on github.

- If you want to use this as a SBHTML theme, then rename the file as such:
LockBackground.html ===> Wallpaper.html
